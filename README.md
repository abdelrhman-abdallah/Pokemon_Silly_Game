Pokemon Battle Game
This is a React project that allows users to play a Pokemon battle game. The game fetches data from the Pokemon API (https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/detail/${id}.png) to generate four random Pokemon cards for each player. Each card includes a Pokemon image, type, and experience points (exp).

To play the game, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-battle-game.git
Navigate to the project directory:
shell
Copy code
cd pokemon-battle-game
Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

shell
Copy code
yarn install
Start the development server:
shell

npm start
or

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the game.

The game will automatically generate four random Pokemon cards for each player, assigning random types and experience points to each Pokemon.

The battle begins! Each player selects a card to play for each round. The player with the highest total experience points wins the round. The game will calculate and display the scores after each round.

Play additional rounds until the game declares a winner.
